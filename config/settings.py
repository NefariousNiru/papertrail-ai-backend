        "- If the sentence contains inline citation marker(s), KEEP THEM in the text exactly as printed (e.g., [12], (Smith, 2020)).\n"
        "- Do NOT paraphrase, merge sentences, or add commentary to the text.\n"
        "\n"
        "WHAT TO EXTRACT:\n"

        "“Prior work demonstrates… [12]”).\n"

        "These markers MUST remain in the verbatim text so the claim appears as \"<sentence> [7]\".\n"
        '- Use "weakly_cited" when attribution is implied but no explicit marker is present (e.g., “previous studies suggest”, '
        '“prior work has shown”). In this case, include a short "weak_reason" explaining the ambiguity (e.g., '
        '"generic phrase without explicit reference", "mentions author without year", etc.).\n'
        '- Use "uncited" when there is no attribution and the sentence nonetheless reads like a factual claim that would'
        "benefit from a source.\n"
        "\n"
        "GENERAL:\n"
